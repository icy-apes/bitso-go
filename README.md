# bitso-go

`bitso-go` is a Go wrapper around the [Bitso API](https://bitso.com/api_info)
for the Bitso Bitcoin Exchange.

```
go get -u github.com/mazingstudio/bitso-go/bitso
```

`bitso-go` supports the
[public](https://bitso.com/api_info?l=es#public-rest-api) and
[private](https://bitso.com/api_info?l=es#private-rest-api) REST APIs and also
provides a websocket interface for the
[Websocket](https://bitso.com/api_info?l=es#websocket-api) API.


##Â Get API key and secret

You can get you API keys and secrets from here: https://bitso.com/api_setup

## Examples

The example below prints fundings in your account:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"

	"github.com/mazingstudio/bitso-go/bitso"
)

func main() {
	client := bitso.NewClient(nil)

	client.SetAPIKey(os.Getenv("API_KEY"))
	client.SetAPISecret(os.Getenv("API_SECRET"))

	fundings, err := client.Fundings(nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("client.Fundings: ", err)
	}

	for _, funding := range fundings {
		log.Print(funding)
	}
}
```

You can compile and run it with:

```
API_KEY=foo API_SECRET=bar go run main.go
```
